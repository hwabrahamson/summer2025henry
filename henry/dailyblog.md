Forgot to do these so I'll just summarize roughly by week:

### Aug 18-22
* Re-completed training / onboarding paperwork
* Uploaded files made earlier in the internship (sales pitch for the dynamic data collection project, diagram of the early simulation)
* Discussed Dual-descent methods with Yongho with an example so that he can implement it in kubernetes
* Started coding the simulation

### Aug 25-29
* Got a plan of action set up with Yongho for the rest of the internship
* Completed Dual-descent centralized implementation
* More simulation coding

### Sept 1-5
* Finished first iteration of the simulation with Markovian environment & strategy
* Tested Markovian-like behaviors with dummy numbers
* Prepped a new presentation for the work with better motivation slides

### Sept 8-12
* Discussed with Yongho about what to do for more realistic numbers, selected AI jobs to act as our test case
* Worked on alternate behaviors for the environment (timecorrelations, preset environment)

### Sept 15-19
* Got the roadside camera data from yongho, labelled & imported it into the sim
* Implemented a converter to generate a dataset for a preset environment given a set of time intervals of activity
* Implemented a new strategy type (WaitingTime) to reflect our 

### Sept 22-26
* Presented the more realistic simulation data -- still promising!
* Started cleaning up the simulation ipynb for public use

### Sept 29- Oct 3
* Completed cleaning up the simulation ipynb
* Created a writeup for the sage website
